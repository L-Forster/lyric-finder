# lyric-finder
For getting song lyrics local


Edit the main file to add the artist you want. When run, it will scrape for all their songs, create a text file, then add the lyrics to that file.

"lyric app" Is a WIP frontend which allows you to search for a song that you have stored, select it, then shows the lyrics. (DOES EVERYTHING APART FROM DISPLAYING THE LYRICS)
